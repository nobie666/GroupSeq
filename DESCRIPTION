Description: Computes probabilities related to group sequential designs for
    normally distributed test statistics. Enables to derive critical
    boundaries, power, drift, and confidence intervals of such designs.
    Supports the alpha spending approach by Lan-DeMets as well as the
    conditional rejection probability principle by Müller and Schäfer.
