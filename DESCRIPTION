Package: GroupSeq
Title: A GUI-based Program to Compute Probabilities Regarding Group Sequential Designs
Version: 1.3.3
Author: Roman Pahl
Description: This package provides a Tcl/Tk-based graphical user interface. It
    enables the construction of group sequential designs based on normally
    distributed test statistics, and particularly to compute critical
    boundaries, power, drift, and confidence intervals for such designs. All
    computations are done via the alpha spending approach by Lan-DeMets.
    Various alpha spending functions are made available to the user for this
    purpose.
